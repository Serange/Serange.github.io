At Staffordshire University, I was awarded First Class Honours in BSc (Hons) Computer Games Programming.
My experience wasn't just about earning a degree, it was where I learned to think critically, collaborate, and explore what drives me.

Through University, I found my passion for Low Level & Graphics Programming which set the foundation for my work within the Games Industry.
