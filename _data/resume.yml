      Following this, the team started work on the next iteration of Sniper Elite, applying lessons learned from the previous port to optimise performance and enhance the overall codebase.
      My responsibilities included mentoring new programmers and updating systems to accommodate newer Apple APIs where older ones had been deprecated, whilst also focussing on
      further Metal support within a newer engine.

      Working at Rebellion was my first role within the games industry, where I began by working on the Apple port of Sniper Elite 4.
      During development, I leveraged my low level graphics expertise to implement Metal as a supported graphics API for the Asura engine.
      I also contributed to integrating various Apple ecosystem features, including On Demand Resources, In App Purchases, and threading with autorelease management.
      Collaborating closely with other programmers and QA, we successfully released Sniper Elite 4 on Apple platforms in January 2025 to a great reception.

    position: "Lead Software Engineer"

    startDate: "2020-08-01"
    endDate: "2023-06-01"
    summary: >
      As lead software engineer for WaterNav, I oversaw full stack development for a cross-platform iOS & Android canal navigation app,
      including APIs, databases, and backend systems.

      I modernized the Android app, ported it to iOS, and built the iOS version from scratch to achieve feature parity and improved performance.

      I eventually managed a small engineering team, coordinating development across both platforms,
      delegating sprint tasks, and integrating staff management systems, such as engineer schedules and stock management, into the app.

      Key features I developed included offline route planning with A* pathfinding, real time live data updates, and RCR membership integration.

      I also contributed to brand growth through trade show demos and live walkthroughs,
      while mentoring developers and optimising workflows to deliver high quality features consistently.
