    Gaming has been an interest of mine from an early age.
    I played on the SNES and PS1 as a kid and fell in love with gaming.
    I quickly became fascinated into how games work under the hood.
    This curiosity naturally evolved into a desire to build and create games myself
    
    I tend to conceptualise game development as creating and designing a jigsaw puzzle.
    Each team develops pieces which connect to an overarching bigger picture. 
    As a programmer, I take pride in developing and refining those pieces so they fit seamlessly together.
    Solving each challenge is deeply rewarding, making me fall evermore in love with all aspects that programming provide.

    I see myself as a very sociable and collaborative person and often take the mantle of leadership in group projects.
    This has aided myself in roles where social and leadership skills become necessary for great team based projects along with developing organisational skills.
    I enjoy being creative and thinking of new innovative ideas for games; being a programmer it helps me express that into an art form I adore. 
    
    Improving my skills and knowledge is key to me bettering myself, the team around me and the games we develop.
    I’m committed to continuously improving my skills by actively seeking feedback on my work and techniques,
    always aiming to grow both personally and as part of a team.
