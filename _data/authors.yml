    Gaming has been an interest of mine from an early age.
    I played on the SNES and PS1 as a kid and fell in love with gaming from an early age.
    It developed into a curiousity of how games worked under the hood, leading to my career in games.
    
    I tend to conceptualise game development as creating and designing a jigsaw puzzle.
    Each team develops pieces which connect to an overarching bigger picture. 
    With programmers coming in to create the pieces used by other teams, slowly transforming these pieces to fit perfectly.
    Working hard to solve each puzzle makes each challenge more rewarding, making me fall evermore in love with all aspects that programming provide.

    I see myself as a very sociable person and often take the mantle of leader role in group projects.
    This has aided myself in roles where social and leadership skills become necessary for great team based projects along with developing organisational skills.
    I enjoy being creative and thinking of new innovative ideas for games; being a programmer it helps me express that into an art form I adore. 
    
    Improving my skills and knowledge is key to me bettering myself and the team around me, so I am always open to feedback on my work and the techniques I use.
