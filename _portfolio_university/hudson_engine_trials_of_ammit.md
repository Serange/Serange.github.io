The Hudson Engine and the game Trials of Ammit were created as part of a group project over the course of 6 weeks.
4 members were from the programming course and 3 were from the development course. 

We were left to plan out how we would allocate the 6 week period to developing the engine, creating game design documents and finally developing and designing the game.
As a team we delegated that the programmers would create the engine whilst developers would spend time crafting a GDD for the first 3 weeks.

The project required tight communication, thorough foreplanning and a strong work ethic. 
With tight time constraints, we had to be concise in our decision making. 
We opted for daily scrums to keep everyone up to date, along with organising smaller
meetings within the departments to talk in further detail about the engine or the game.

As part of the programming team I was tasked with working on the engine. 
Being the most confident in the area I took the responsibility of implementing our OpenGL Renderer.

Our engine has a ECS-like design so the engine looks for entities with a sprite component attached and updates the entity accordingly.
Obviously we needed the fundamentals like being able to draw to the screen, along with this allowing some flexibility for the editor to allow developers
to adapt their workspace to how they see fit.

Alongside this I added custom tool support into the engine. Devs and Programmers could easily build systems and attach it to the editor.

We decided to go for an egyptian themed game so we could play into the mythology for design ideas. 
We had the player going through the mythical stages of the afterlife. 
Twisting the original mythology to be a trial of combat.

My role on the game itself was maitaining support for all the rendering and editor adaptations required.
I also worked on assisting developers to get familiar with the engine.
Then after a few days after of building tools and engine functionality for the team, I moved over to helping to create the game.
